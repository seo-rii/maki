# Review remediation log

The independent code and architecture review dated 2026-09-02
(`maki-review-report.md`) rated Maki a strong alpha but a production **No-Go**,
and listed 18 findings (M-001 … M-018). This page tracks what has been done
about each one, in the review's own order. It is updated in the same commit as
the fix it describes.

Status values: **Fixed** (regression test landed and passes), **Partial**
(behaviour improved, remaining gap described), **Open**.

## P0 — before storing any real data

| Finding | Status | Change | Regression tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| M-001 wrong key / provider not rejected at attach | Open | — | — |
| M-002 automatic roll can drop a durable overwrite from the overlay | Fixed | The volume promotes the overlay to the journal's durable boundary after *every* `append` (including a failed one) and before publishing the new version; `checkpoint` re-promotes from the journal boundary before collecting. A roll whose fdatasync fails now keeps the segment active instead of dropping it, so a later FLUSH still syncs it. | `auto_roll_preserves_previous_durable_overwrite`, `failed_append_after_roll_still_promotes_durable_versions`, `failed_seal_sync_does_not_lose_active_segment_durability` |
| M-003 allocation-map retry can skip the directory fsync | Fixed | `persist_allocations` writes every dirty A/B copy, fsyncs the data directory, and only then clears the dirty flags; a new `checkpoint.alloc_dirsync` failpoint covers the fsync. | `checkpoint_retry_keeps_allocation_dirent_durable`; the failpoint joined `crash_mid_checkpoint_at_every_boundary_recovers_consistently` |
| M-007 recovery misclassifies durable corruption as a torn tail | Fixed | See [Recovery fail-closed rules](#recovery-fail-closed-rules). | `recovery_rejects_missing_first_uncheckpointed_segment`, `recovery_rejects_gap_after_checkpoint_boundary`, `recovery_rejects_full_final_segment_bad_header`, `recovery_rejects_corrupt_middle_record_header_in_final_segment`, `recovery_rejects_oversized_segment_before_allocation`, `recovery_rejects_damage_inside_durable_mark_even_at_the_tail`, `recovery_truncates_volatile_damage_despite_valid_successor`, `recovery_rejects_segment_shorter_than_durable_mark`, plus the bounded-scanner tests in `review_format.rs` |
| M-008 fake provider in the default release feature | Open | — | — |

## P1 — before a limited beta

| Finding | Status | Change | Regression tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| M-004 no automatic checkpointing; journal / free-space bounds unenforced | Open | — | — |
| M-005 control socket not started by the daemon; no-op reloads | Open | — | — |
| M-006 mount-identity verification is a no-op | Open | — | — |
| M-009 A/B reader collapses I/O errors into "invalid copy" | Fixed | `AbStore` reports any I/O failure other than not-found as an error; empty, short, and CRC-invalid copies remain "invalid". `create_volume` writes both checkpoint-state copies (sequence 0) and recovery requires a valid copy on every volume instead of defaulting to 0. | `recovery_requires_valid_checkpoint_state`, `recovery_surfaces_hard_io_error_on_checkpoint_state`, `ab_load_reports_hard_io_errors_instead_of_masking_them`, `ab_load_treats_missing_empty_and_corrupt_sides_as_invalid_copies`, `create_volume_writes_checkpoint_state_and_durable_mark` |
| M-010 retry ignores `retry_safe`; no absolute deadline | Open | — | — |
| M-011 unvalidated endpoints enter the serving pool | Open | — | — |
| M-012 reordered batch results undetected (WebSocket, positional HTTP) | Open | — | — |
| M-013 incomplete configuration validation; placebo settings | Open | — | — |
| M-014 production sample cannot attach | Open | — | — |
| M-015 WebSocket / gRPC without TLS | Open | — | — |
| M-016 privileged attach: allocation, rollback, config-driven execution | Open | — | — |
| M-017 control-socket group ownership | Open | — | — |
| M-018 offline checker too shallow | Open | — | — |

## Recovery fail-closed rules

Recovery (`maki-core/src/recovery.rs`) now refuses to attach on anything that
is not provably a crash artifact:

- **Bridging.** The oldest surviving segment must start at or before
  `checkpoint_sequence + 1`. A later base sequence means an uncheckpointed
  segment disappeared; internal contiguity of the survivors is no longer
  enough. (A missing *last* segment remains undetectable without additional
  metadata; the writer never acknowledges a record before the segment's
  directory entry is durable, so this needs external damage.)
- **Final-segment header.** A final segment shorter than a header, or entirely
  zero-filled, is a creation crash and is discarded. A complete header that
  fails magic, version, or CRC is durable damage.
- **Size cap.** A segment longer than `max_segment_file_size(segment_size)`
  is rejected before it is read into memory.
- **Durable mark.** After every successful segment fdatasync the journal
  writer records `(segment index, synced byte count)` in
  `journal/durable-mark` with a plain, unsynced write. The mark is only ever
  a lower bound. Recovery classifies damage *before* the mark as corruption
  even when it sits at the very end of the segment, and damage *after* the
  mark as a torn tail even when an intact record follows it. The second half
  matters: records after the last fdatasync may persist in any order, so a
  later unsynced record surviving while an earlier one is lost is a legal
  crash outcome, not corruption. Without a mark the scanner falls back to the
  previous heuristic (payload-CRC failure immediately followed by a valid
  successor is corruption).

## On-disk additions

Both additions are new files; no existing structure changed, so the format
version stays at 1. Volumes created before these changes lack both files:

- `checkpoint/state.{a,b}` are now written at creation and **required** by
  recovery. A pre-existing volume that was never checkpointed will fail to
  attach with `no valid checkpoint state copy`.
- `journal/durable-mark` is created empty at creation and recreated lazily by
  the writer if absent. Its absence only weakens corruption detection.
